# The Last Meeting

## Description
In **The Last Meeting**, you play as *Clay*, a 15-year-old who recently lost his mother in a car accident. On the night of the accident, Clay dreams of her, but suddenly a ghost grabs him by the ankles and drags him away into a dark and foreboding forest. Darkness consumes him, and the journey begins.

This game is a roguelike set in a dungeon with 3 levels and intense boss fights. It was developed as part of an online Unity course, where the team gained foundational knowledge and key skills for game development.

### Mechanics:
- Dungeon exploration with procedurally generated levels.
- Boss fights at the end of each level.
- Roguelike progression with permadeath mechanics.

*Note: The game was created using techniques learned from a Unity online course.*
